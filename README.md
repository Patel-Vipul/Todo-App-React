# 📝 Todo App (React + Context API + Tailwind)

This is a Todo App I created while learning React.  
The main goal of this project was to understand state management using **Context API**, practice **React Hooks**, and style UI using **Tailwind CSS**.  
I kept the UI clean and added a few useful features to make it feel like a real task manager instead of just a basic todo list.
